        },
        "whatIncluded": {
          "question": "What's included in my custom mystery package?",
          "answer": "Everything you need: a comprehensive host guide with step-by-step instructions, detailed character profiles for each player, clues, evidence, and all game materials. No additional preparation required."
        },
        "gameDuration": {
          "question": "How long does a typical game last?",
          "answer": "Most mysteries run 2-3 hours, but you control the pacing. Our host guide includes timing suggestions that you can adjust to fit your schedule."
        },
        "themedMysteries": {
          "question": "Do you offer themed mysteries for special occasions?",
          "answer": "We create any theme you can imagine! From classic 1920s speakeasies to space stations to fairy tale kingdoms - tell us your vision and we'll make it happen."
        },
        "ageRecommendation": {
          "question": "Is there an age recommendation for your mysteries?",
          "answer": "Our standard mysteries work great for adults and teens (13+). You can also request family-friendly themes when creating your mystery for younger players."
        },
        "freePreview": {
          "question": "What's included in the free preview?",
          "answer": "You can create unlimited mystery previews for free, including the basic story premise and character concepts. This lets you explore different ideas before purchasing."
        },
        "purchaseIncludes": {
          "question": "What do I get when I purchase a mystery?",
          "answer": "For $24.99, you receive everything needed to host: comprehensive host guide, detailed character profiles for each player, clues, evidence, and all game materials ready to use."
        },
        "refund": {
          "question": "Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, contact us within 7 days and we'll issue a full refund, no questions asked."
        },
        "gameDesignEngagement": {
          "question": "Hur säkerställer er speldesign att alla förblir engagerade?",
          "answer": "Våra mysterier fokuserar på rika karaktärsinteraktioner snarare än rigida berättelser. Varje karaktär har detaljerade bakgrunder och motiv som driver naturligt spelande, vilket säkerställer att alla spelare förblir aktivt involverade under hela upplevelsen."
        },
        "dynamicMurderer": {
          "question": "Varför pekar inte ledtrådarna på en specifik mördare från början?",
          "answer": "Mördaren bestäms efter första omgången baserat på ledtrådar som avslöjas under spelet. Detta dynamiska tillvägagångssätt innebär att ledtrådar byggs progressivt, vilket gör mysteriet lösbart även om vissa detaljer missas i feststämningen."
        },
        "flexiblePlayerCount": {
          "question": "Vad händer om någon inte kan komma i sista minuten?",
          "answer": "Vår flexibla design hanterar ändringar i sista minuten. Eftersom spelet inte är beroende av att en karaktär har kritisk information kan du justera ditt antal spelare utan att förstöra mysteriet."
        },
        "characterFocused": {
          "question": "Varför karaktärsfokuserad istället för plotfokuserad?",
          "answer": "Års erfarenhet har lärt oss att alltför specifika ledtrådar missas på fester. Vårt karaktärsdrivna tillvägagångssätt innebär att mysteriet utvecklas naturligt genom interaktioner."
